<p align="center">Speech recognition with Python language and the speech_recognition library.</p>

## About the project

This project was created to see how speech recognition works using the Python language.

## How it works?

The user will say something in the microphone, and Python will understand and write what the user is saying.

## Why?

Just to practice my Python skills more and and see how the library works.

## Prerequisites

pip install SpeechRecognition.

You need to install Pyaudio compatible with your computer at this link: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio.

And finally, just install the file you downloaded like this: pip install (the file you downloaded).
